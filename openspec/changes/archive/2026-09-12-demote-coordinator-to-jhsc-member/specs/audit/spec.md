## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Account and scope changes are audited in the chain of every site they reach

The system SHALL record an audit entry for the creation of an account, for a change of its `role`
or its `email`, for its deactivation and reactivation, and for every grant and revocation of a
site scope, written by the database in the same transaction as the change.
The promotion of a `jhsc_member` to `hs_coordinator` and the demotion of an `hs_coordinator` to
`jhsc_member` SHALL each be recorded as the role change it is, and SHALL be the only role changes
the system produces.

Because an account is not itself a site-scoped record while every audit entry belongs to exactly
one site, an account event SHALL be written once into the chain of each site in the account's
effective scope, and a scope event SHALL be written into the chain of the site being granted or
revoked. "Who was given access to this workplace, and when" is part of that workplace's record.

#### Scenario: Creating an account with two sites writes an entry in each chain

- **WHEN** an account is created with an active scope of both sites
- **THEN** one `audit_log` entry identifying the account creation exists in the chain of
  `st-thomas` and one in the chain of `glencoe`
- **AND** both payloads carry the account identifier, the `person_id` and the `role`

#### Scenario: A promotion is recorded with both roles

- **WHEN** an account's `role` is changed from `jhsc_member` to `hs_coordinator`
- **THEN** an entry exists in the chain of every site in the account's scope
- **AND** its `payload` contains the previous and the new `role`

#### Scenario: A demotion is recorded with both roles

- **WHEN** an account's `role` is changed from `hs_coordinator` to `jhsc_member`
- **THEN** an entry exists in the chain of every site in the account's scope
- **AND** its `payload` contains the previous and the new `role`

#### Scenario: An email change is recorded with both values

- **WHEN** an account's `email` is updated
- **THEN** an entry exists in the chain of every site in the account's scope
- **AND** its `payload` contains the previous and the new `email`

#### Scenario: A scope grant is recorded in the site being granted

- **WHEN** an account is granted the site `glencoe`
- **THEN** an `audit_log` entry identifying the grant exists in the chain of `glencoe`
- **AND** no entry for that grant exists in the chain of `st-thomas`

#### Scenario: A scope revocation is recorded in the site being revoked

- **WHEN** `revoked_at` is set on an account's scope row for `glencoe`
- **THEN** an `audit_log` entry identifying the revocation exists in the chain of `glencoe`

#### Scenario: Deactivating an account is recorded in every site it reached

- **WHEN** `deactivated_at` is set on an account whose active scope is both sites
- **THEN** an entry identifying the deactivation exists in both chains

#### Scenario: An account with an empty scope writes no account entry

- **WHEN** an account is created with no active scope row
- **THEN** the creation succeeds
- **AND** no `audit_log` entry is written for it, because it reaches no workplace
